# Configuration

## Introduction

Spark is [Adevinta’s](https://www.adevinta.com/) iOS Design System.

Its mission is to provide an easy to use, customizable UI experience for consumers.

This repository contains a SPM (Swift Package Manager) to manage the common code using by all Spark iOS repositories.
It also contains the snapshot testing strategy with the external ```swift-snapshot-testing``` dependencies.

**Note**: A customer is not supposed to have access to this code. 

## SPM

To open the project on Xcode, you just need to double click on the ```Package.swift```.

The SPM is composed by 
- Targets (all are protected by @_spi annotation to be accessible just be the Spark team.) :
  - **SparkCommon**: Common public code.
  - **SparkCommonSnapshotTesting**: Public snapshot test cases, mock and extensions.
  - **SparkCommonTesting**: Public protocols mocks

- Unit Tests:
  - **SparkCommonSnapshotTests**: Unit tests for the Common Snapshot target
  - **SparkCommonUnitTests**: Unit tests for the Common target

## Guidelines

There is two importants rules for this repository:
- All ```protocols```, ```class```, ```struct```, ```var/let/func```, ..., used by at least one component (or other) in **```public```** or **```open```**.
- If the code can be used only by the **spark iOS team**, all ```public``` or **```open```** must contains the **```@_spi(SI_SPI)```** annotation. If the code can also be used by consommer too, you don't need to add this annotation.
